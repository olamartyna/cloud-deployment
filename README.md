# Cloud Deployment

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance
[here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/distributed_applications/cloud_deployment/HOW_TO_COACH.x.md)_

In this module you will learn to:

* Explain how code goes from running on your computer to running on a publicly
  accessible server.
* Explain how continuous integration and deployment (CI-CD) is used in software
  teams.
* Deploy a database-backed web application to the cloud using CI-CD.

You will achieve these by working through a sequence of exercises and
challenges.

## Sequence

Work through each of these exercises in sequence.

### Phase Zero: Introduction

1. [Introduction to the module](00_introduction/01_introduction.md)

### Phase One: Networking

These exercises build up your understanding of the current Internet by looking
at its history, development, and some practical tools.

1. [`ping`, and how we persuaded computers to talk](01_internet/01_ping_bite.md)
2. [`traceroute`, and how we organised computers into networks](01_internet/02_traceroute_bite.md)
3. [`telnet`, and how formed many connections over one cable](01_internet/03_telnet_bite.md)
4. [`curl`, and how we developed common languages](01_internet/04_curl_bite.md)
5. [`dig`, and how developed human-readable names](01_internet/05_dig_bite.md)
6. [`mkcert`, and how we secured the internet](01_internet/06_mkcert_bite.md)
7. [`docker`, and how we created the cloud](01_internet/07_docker_bite.md)

### Phase Two: Wrapping up Servers

These exercises guide you through deploying a web application in a container
using Docker.

1. [Containerising a web server](02_containers/01_containerising.md)
2. [Deploying a web server](02_containers/02_deploying.md)
3. [Connecting a container to a database](02_containers/03_connecting_to_a_database.md)
4. [Removing secrets](02_containers/04_removing_secrets.md)

### Phase Three: CI-CD

These exercises guide you through setting up Continuous Integration and
Deployment for a web application.

1. [Continuous Integration: Running the test suite](03_shipping/01_ci.md)
2. [Continuous Deployment: Deploying the system](03_shipping/02_cd.md)
