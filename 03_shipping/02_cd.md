# Continuous Deployment

In this phase we will take a web application and set up Continuous Integration
and Continuous Deployment. In this step we will set up CD to form CI-CD.

## Objective

Learn to explain what continuous deployment is and why it is used.

Continuous deployment is CI taken to the extreme ‚Äî if the branch is integrated
and the tests pass post-merge, the code is immediately deployed to production.

This might seem a little rash. What if there are defects in the code that
weren't picked up during integration?

A CD-enthusiast would say: well, all the more reason to pick them up during
integration with a thorough test suite and a rigorous quality process including
human review.

It's an interesting argument. Organisations differ on how far they go towards
true continuous deployment. While some teams swear by it, others view it as too
risky or expensive to manage.

One thing teams generally do agree on is that deployment should be automated to
a large extent. So regardless of the policy, the tools of CD are useful.

Let's set up true Continuous Deployment for our server.

We're going to use a combination of Github actions and the Exoframe 'tokens'
feature to allow us to deploy from automated jobs where we can't log in
ourselves.

### First look at the config

We'll need to add a section to our workflow. The first `test` part is the same
as before, so focus instead on the `deploy` section.

> **Notice**  
> Don't add this to your repository just yet.

```yml
# The name of the workflow
name: Test and Deploy

# This workflow will run on any push to the repository
on: push

jobs:
  test:
    # Similar to docker, we set up a virtual machine to run our tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Each step has a name, some code, and some options
      - name: Check out the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3 # This is a reference to some code to run

      # This step installs the Python version we want
      - name: Set up Python 3.11
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.11

      # This step installs pip, pipenv, and our dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: | # Note that there's no reference here ‚Äî just commands to run
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pipenv
          pipenv install --dev

      # Now we run our tests
      - name: Test with pytest
        run: |
          pipenv run pytest

  deploy:
    # If we're running on the main branch (not a PR)
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

    # And the tests have run
    needs: test

    # And no other deploy jobs are running
    concurrency: production

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # For exoframe we need NodeJS
      - name: Set up Node.js 16
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 16

      # We install exoframe
      - name: Install exoframe
        run: npm install -g exoframe

      # And deploy using our secret token
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          exoframe deploy --token ${{ secrets.EXOFRAME_TOKEN }} --endpoint "https://exoframe.xf.mkrs.link" --update
```

Pay particular attention to that last line. This is the code broken down:

```shell
; exoframe deploy
  --token ${{ secrets.EXOFRAME_TOKEN }} 
  --endpoint "https://exoframe.xf.mkrs.link" 
  --update
```

We'll look at the secret token next.

### Generating the secret deployment token

Because we don't have a terminal inside Github actions that we can use to log
in, we need to use a different way to deploy. Instead of logging in, we will
generate a _deployment token_ that grants permission to deploy.

Let's generate one now:

```shell
# In your shell
; exoframe token
Generating new deployment token for: https://exoframe.xf.mkrs.link
? Token name: github_deploy
New token generated:

...SECRET CONTENTS...

WARNING! Make sure to write it down, you will not be able to get it again!
```

Copy that token. _Don't_ commit it anywhere. Since it grants special permission
to deploy to our server, this token is also a secret that we can't store in code
or config.

Instead, we're going to use the Github secrets functionality. Github will look
after our secret token and pass it to the CI-CD process when it runs.

Get to Github secrets by going to your repository, clicking the 'Settings' tab,
clicking 'Secrets' in the left hand menu, and then 'Actions'. Then click the big
green 'New repository secret' button. You should see a form with 'Name' and
'Secret' fields.

Type in the name `EXOFRAME_TOKEN` and paste your token into the Secret box.

### Setting up the deployment

First we'll configure our simple server for Exoframe and manually deploy it.

```shell
; exoframe config -d "YOURNAME-simple-ci.xf.mkrs.link" --port 5000
; exoframe deploy
```

Wait a minute for the server to set up. Then visit it to verify it is working.

### Adding the new workflow config

Jump back up to [the config](#first-look-at-the-config) and copy it into your
repository, replacing the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file.

Switch to the main branch if you're not there already, commit and push the
changes.

```shell
# Switch to main and pull the latest changes
; git switch main
; git pull --rebase 

# Commit and push the new config
; git add .
; git commit -m "Add deploy workflow"
; git push
```

You should see the test and deploy workflows succeed.

### Exercise

At this point it's over to you to make some changes to your app as you see fit.
Try branching off and merging in to try out the CI-CD workflow.

To get you started: try changing the `GET /` route to respond with "I am a CI-CD
hero!"
